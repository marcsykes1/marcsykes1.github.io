In such cases, the User in question will be informed.</li><li><b>Financing, Business Transfers, and Similar Transactions:</b> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.

Where We Store Your Data</h2><p>All information you provide to us is stored in the servers of our cloud service providers. We take reasonable steps to ensure our service providers adhere to the security standards we apply to your information. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p><p>Our Platform is hosted Canada. However, some of our third-party service providers may be located outside of Canada. While we use appropriate safeguards to keep your information secure, the laws in other places may differ from those in Canada and authorities in those jurisdictions may access your information in accordance with their local laws.</p><h2 class="h3">6. Safeguards</h2><p>RealDesk takes the safeguarding of your information very seriously. We have implemented commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal data in our custody and control.</p><p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Platform; and thus any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p><h2 class="h3">7. Your Rights</h2><p>You have certain rights relating to your personal data, subject to local data protection laws.

We may communicate with our third-party service providers, to the extent permitted by law, when you make a request based on your personal data rights that involves the data collected by our third-party service providers. We will keep you informed on the status of your request in such cases.</p><h2 class="h3">8. Third-Party Links, Websites, Apps, and Communication Technologies</h2><p>Our Platform may contain links to other websites or software applications that RealDesk does not own or operate, including the websites or software applications of third-party partners. Also, links to our Platform may be featured on third party websites on which we advertise. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your consent. We provide links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. We do not have any control over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat your personal information.</p><p>We may offer you the opportunity to engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins, and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the website, plug-in or application. When you provide information from your social media account, we may use this information to personalize your experience on the Website and on the third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, and to provide you with other products or services you may request.</p><h2 class="h3">9. Third-Party Analytics</h2><p>RealDesk may use certain web analytics services (e.g. Google Analytics, Hubspot, etc)] to collect standard internet log information. Tools such as these may use cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the Website. For example, with Google Analytics, the information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server. Google uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Platform, compiling reports on Platform activity, and providing RealDesk with other services relating to Platform activity and internet usage. You can prevent the storage of data relating to your use of the Website and created via the cookie (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p><p>You can also obtain additional information on Google Analytics’ collection and processing of data and data privacy and security at the following links: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631">https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631</a>.</p><h2 class="h3">10. Google API Limited Use Disclosure</h2><p>RealDesk uses Google’s Application Programming Interface (API) Services to enable the user authorization feature for accessing the RealDesk platform (i.e. use of your Gmail account to sync your Google Calendar to the RealDesk platform).</p><p>RealDesk utilizes the Google Calendar API to sync and track events between the Platform’s calendar and Google Calendar. The Platform's calendar offers the ability to add events and reminders for the User, including: listing expiration dates, property showing dates, condition removal dates, completion or possession dates, client’s birthdays, prospect follow up and interview dates, and custom events.</p><p>RealDesk’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the <a href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13463073?visit_id=638712561056161093-1431849348&rd=1#explain-types">Limited Use Requirements</a>.</p><p>Your Google information is used by our system developers to provide or improve user-facing features that are prominent to your user experience.

Third-Party Ad Networks</h2><p>We may use third parties, such as network advertisers and other marketing agents, to display advertisements on our Platform, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Platform and unrelated third-party websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your use of our Platform, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to or Users of our Platform.</p><h2 class="h3">12. Data Retention</h2><p>RealDesk will only retain your personal data while it is needed to fulfill the intended purpose for which it was collected or as otherwise permitted or required by law or contract (which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you).</p><p>Typically, personal data is maintained during the time you are a User or client of the Platform, or for up to a year following our last contact with you. We may retain certain data as necessary for:</p><p></p><ul><li>Legitimate business purposes, such as auditing or account recovery;</li><li>If required by applicable federal, state, provincial, or other laws;</li><li>To prevent fraud or future abuse; or</li><li>By contract with an Affiliate or third-party provider.</li></ul><p>All retained personal data is treated in accordance with this Policy.</p><p>If you request that your personal data be removed from our databases and/or systems, it may not be possible to completely delete all your personal data due to technological and legal constraints. However, we will take such steps as are reasonable to securely destroy the information or to ensure that the information is de-identified and/or anonymized as necessary.</p><h2 class="h3">13. Children's Privacy</h2><p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 and do not target our Platform to children under 16.
